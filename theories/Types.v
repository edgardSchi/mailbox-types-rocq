(*Inductive Unrestricted : TUsage -> Prop :=*)
(*    unBase : forall c : BType, Unrestricted (TUBase c)*)
(*  | unOne : Unrestricted (TUUsage SecondClass (! 𝟙)).*)

(** In the original paper, the predicate Unrestricted is defined over a syntactic
    check, i.e. Un(T) <=> T = ! 𝟙 ^^ ◦.

    However, this definition breaks transitivity of environment subtyping. As an
    example, consider environment [[! 𝟙 ^^ •]]. The type [! 𝟙 ^^ •] is not unrestricted,
    so, [[! 𝟙 ^^ •] ≤ₑ []] does not hold. But [! 𝟙 ^^ • ≤ ! 𝟙 ^^ ◦] holds, and 
    [[! 𝟙 ^^ ◦] ≤ₑ []] holds since the type is unrestricted.

    So in the typing rules we would have to use the [TSub]-rule twice in order to
    weaken the environment from [[! 𝟙 ^^ •]] to [[]].
    To avoid this, we define a type to be unrestricted, if it is a subtype of [! 𝟙 ^^ ◦].

    A cruft type represents a type that can be added
   through the subtyping rule which may not be used
